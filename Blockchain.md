# Blockchain

IBM Blockchain is the first managed service for Hyperledger Fabric, making it fast and easy to build, run and govern business networks while ensuring high levels of security, privacy, and performance. The service enables the creation of blockchain business networks with ownership and control distributed across different organizations. New networks can be bootstrapped by setting up governance rules, inviting members, and configuring network policies. Operators can use dashboards and governance tooling to run and maintain the network.
